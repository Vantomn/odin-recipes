    <h1>Chicken Makhani (Indian Butter Chicken)</h1>
    <img src="/recipes/allrecipes_chickenmakhani.webp" />
    <p>Chicken Makhani is an indian butter chicken recipe that features a
        full-flavored sauce that compliments the chicken perfectly and can be made as mild or
        as spicy as you want by adjusting the cayenne when cooking. This dish is also served with basmati rice and naan bread, 
        so be aware that it is carb heavy, but if you can replace these two options if you want it to be 
        slightly less in carbs with an alternative like quinoa.
